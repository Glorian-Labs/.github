# Glorian Labs

**Agentic Intelligence for the Next Economy**

Glorian Labs is an independent research lab at the intersection of AI agents and decentralized economies. We build autonomous AI systems and tools for the next economic paradigm — open-source prototypes that enable intelligent coordination, agentic decision-making, and new economic primitives in Web3.

Focus: Hedera, Aptos, and the agentic economy.
